<h3>Guy Richie (The Covenant)</h3>
<p>This movie is my favorite movie of 2023. <br />
It is true life event that happened somewhere in Afghanistan. it talked about keeping <br> a real covenant and fulfilling them.</p>

<h3>Extraction 2</h3>
<p>This is one of my best action movie of 2023.<br />
A movie full of endless action, love, betrayal and trust, also not forgetting family as well. <br> I really enjoy watching this movie, i could watch it over and over again without getting tired.</p>

<h3>The Super Mario Bros</h3>
<p>My favorite comic movie of 2023.<br />
The love I personally have for this movie is something else, maybe because it is a comic cartoon <br> and i love cartoons very much.</p>
